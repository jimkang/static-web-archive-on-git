static-web-archive-on-git
==================

**[Now deprecated in favor of https://github.com/jimkang/static-web-archive-on-git](https://github.com/jimkang/static-web-archive)**

A module that maintains a static web archive that you can add to piece by piece. For image bots in particular.

Requires a version of Node that supports ES 6.

Installation
------------

    npm install static-web-archive-on-git

Usage
-----

The idea here is that you have a GitHub repo that is the source for a lightweight static weblog, and you have a program that you want to update it programmatically.

So, in your program, you create an instance of this module like so:

    var StaticWebArchiveOnGit = require('-static-web-archive-on-git');
    var staticWebStream = StaticWebArchiveOnGit({
      title: 'Vape bot archives',
      footerHTML: `<div>Bottom of page</div>`,
      config: {
        gitRepoOwner: 'your GitHub username',
        gitToken: 'Your personal access token from https://github.com/settings/tokens (the token needs repo access)',
        repo: 'the name of the repo that contains the archive'
      },
      maxEntriesPerPage: 25
    })

Then, when the program has a new post, get it into the archive on git like so:

    staticWebStream.write({
      id: 'my-unique-post-id-a',
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      mediaFilename: 'smidgeo_headshot.jpg',
      caption: 'Smidgeo!',
      buffer: <The buffer containing the appropriate image>
    });

Or:

    staticWebStream.write({
      id: 'my-unique-post-id-b',
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      isVideo: true,
      mediaFilename: 'pbDLD37qZWDBGBHW.mp4',
      caption: 'A window.',
      buffer: <The buffer containing the appropriate video>
    });

Then, when you're all done, you close the stream like so:

    staticWebStream.end(handleError);

    function handleError(error) {
      if (error) {
        console.log('Aw dag, there was an error shutting things down!', error);
      }
    }

After the above runs, in the git repo, there will be:

- An `index.html` that contains the latest n posts. If there are more than n total entries, there will be a `1.html`, a `2.html`, and so forth containing previous entries. The footer of each will link to previous pages.
- HTML files in the root directory for each individual post.
- The HTML files refer to an `app.css`. It's up to you to add that to your web archive repo. [Here's one I use for one of my archives.](https://github.com/jimkang/static-web-archive-on-git/blob/master/meta/app.css)
- A `/media/` directory containing the given media files.
- A `/meta` directory containing line-delimited JSON that has the contents of the posts and a `last-page.txt` file that tells this module what the last page is so that it knows which index to update.

You can also look at `tests/integration/post-through-chain-test.js` to get an idea.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
